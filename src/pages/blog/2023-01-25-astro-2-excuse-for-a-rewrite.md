This website is only three months old. 
But a new verion of the tool I use to make it is out so I have to re-write everything... well it is an excuse.
I don't even know what is new in Astro 2 yet, probably nothing that affects this simple static blog site.

There are some more things I want to try when I re-write:

- Use MDX
    - So far I've only use plain md (with yaml frontmatter) because it is rather future proof
    - Maybe if I keep the components simple it'll be easy roll forward to the next tool or framework I decide to re-write in
    - I want to write components for displaying code blocks nicely - expandable
    - Maybe I should just figure out how to do this through Remark...  this might be the right answer
    - I would like to render custom components for everything (via Remark plugins?) instead of the default HTML.
    - Then I can dump Tailwind typography
- Add interactive stuff using Astro islands
    - I did have an idea for what I wanted to do but now I've forgotten.
- Get round to importing the pages from my old blog site

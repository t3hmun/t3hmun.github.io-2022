## What

I don't like the template CSS so it needs to be customised.
An opportunity to learn Tailwind CSS.
I have no idea what Tailwind is or does, but I've heard good things.

## Setup

- `npx astro add tailwind`
- Answer yes to all questions
- Remove global.css
- Now everthing looks reset and bad
- Go learn what Tailwind does...
